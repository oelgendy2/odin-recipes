    <p>Koshary, kushari or koshari (Egyptian Arabic: كشري [ˈkoʃɑɾi]) is Egypt's national dish and a widely popular street food.[1] A traditional Egyptian staple, mixing pasta, Egyptian fried rice, vermicelli and brown lentils,[2][3] and topped with a zesty tomato sauce, garlic vinegar and garnished with chickpeas and crispy fried onions. It is often served with sprinklings of garlic juice; garlic vinegar and hot sauce are optional.</p>
